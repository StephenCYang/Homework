## 05-Matplotlib homework

Wow, this actually worked!

Note: Based on various metrics (final tumor volume and change in tumor volume), it's unclear why the sample shows Infubinol as one of the best 4. In it's place, the data shows Propriva is better. So my graphs reflect that regimen instead.


Update: Originally used sklearn.linear_model for it's LinearRegression function. Went back to use the regular ScyPy library instead.matplotlib
