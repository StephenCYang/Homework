' Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output
' the following information.

' - The ticker symbol.
' - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the
'   closing price at the end of that year.
' - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to
'   the closing price at the end of that year.
' - The total stock volume of the stock.
' - You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive
'   change in green and negative change in red.



' Initialize some variables

' Assuming row 1 is headers, set the beginning result row to 2.

' Set the initial opening price for the first record from column 3 (aka C).

' Initialize the TotalStockVolume to 0

' Initialize Greatest % Increase variables

' Initialize Greatest % Decrease variables

' Initialize GreatestVolume variables

' Headers and legends
Range("j1") = "Ticker"
Range("k1") = "Yearly Change"
Range("L1") = "Percent Change"

Range("P2") = "Greatest % Increase"
Range("P3") = "Greatest % Decrease"
Range("P4") = "Greatest Total Volume"

' This assumes all ticker names are sorted by ticker name and date.



' Start from row 2, because row 1 is headers.

' Are we at the end of the table?

    ' Check to see if the ticker name changes.

        ' If the names don't match, it's a new stock.
    
            ' write these out the Ticker name

            
            ' get the closing price from column 6 (aka F).

        
            ' Calculate the change in price
        
            ' Set the cell color. Positive is Green, Negative is Red, 0 is no change.
        
            ' write the change to column 11.
        
            ' Calc percentage change. Check for 0 value to avoid Range errors.

            ' Basically, if the next opening price is 0, and that we haven't reached the end of the table,
            ' and the ticker name hasn't changed, we check the line after it and use the opening pricefrom there.
                        
            ' Iterate the current output row
        
    
        ' Else we accumulate the stock volume from column 7 (aka G) starting with the next row.
        
' Increment the row number we're looking at.
